  ### Week Five: 3D Printing 

  <em>Added March 1</em>



  <h3>3D Printing</h3>

<h4>Item One: Spring</h4>
I wanted to pring objects with different geometries and try to wrap my head around what the advantages of 3D printing are. I began CAD modeling in Fusion, but quickly realized that there is both some gaps in my knowledge of how to use the program  alongside what I think is some lack of feartures for quikly making complex geometries and patterns. Nonetheless I wanted to know what the process of modeling in Fusion, exporting to Prussa and printing was like. I tried and fialed multiple prints of this object.

I learned of the essential feature of Prussa Slicer beings able to add in support material. I too was running into problems using a .15 mm layer, 0.20 worked much better, but I'm not sure why. 

This item is a good candidate for 3D printing, because it woould be difficult (impossible?) to mill. Even on a 5-axis machine, I cannot see how any bit would be able to subtract the material to make the internal contours to the spring's geometry. It seems as though there will always be a peice that cannot be reached internally.

<h4>Item Two: Mobius Strip</h4>
The item is a bit commonplace as far as cool geomtries go, but I wanted to have something with this sort of curvature to think about how an item, to be successully milled might have to be turned upside down, or more generally I guess, would need to be clammped in multiple positions in order to be completed. My thinking so far is that a mill likely would be able to make this part, but with multiple repositionings. This seems time intensive. 

<p>On this one I learned how to load a new filament into the printer. </p>

<h4>Item Three: Pencil Holder with Multiple Spiraling Flutes</h4>
This item I too think would be  difficult to mill one for flutes that run up and down the sides, It is unclear to me that a machine would be able to make these easily, but it does seem possible. 

The bigger problem, I think, is the hidden sort of under pot. If there is a concave shape, say a sort of cone or bowl, the apex pointing away from a plane, I think impossible to create by subtractive methods this concave bowl is there is, on that plane a peice of material that does not allow a bit to reach all parts of that bowl.

<p>On this one I learned to check scale/ dimensions before printing because this pencil-holder is definetely too small for your average-sized pencil.</p>

  <h3> Scanning</h3>
  Picking a program: 
  After looking at all the avaliable resources listed on the class website, I was so physched to use ALICE VISION. I began the download process, but realized that the bootcamp partition for Windows on my MAC didn't have enough storage to handle another program. 

<p>
  I then, when stumbling around the lab, found the SENSE scanner by 3D Systems. I thought that this was sure to work so much better than what I was going to acheive with ALICE VISION. 
</p>

  <p>
    I toyed around with it first with black items, which I thoght would work best for scanning in stark contrast to the white table one which I was working. The scans started out alright in the direction from which there was more light. It was when I got around to a certain point, where there were shadows falling from the item onto the table that I ran into problems. 
    </p>

  <p>I learned here that the user's manual was serious, shadows can mess up your scan. 
    </p>
  


<h4>First Scan </h4>
The next scan was of a metal ring, the very one we use to hold material down on the laser cutter. It seemed to work better in new light, but when I got around to a certain point, looking only at the side of the ring, where the hole isn't visible, the scan continued to fail to recongize the object.

<p>For comparison, a picutre of the ring </p>

<h4>Second Scan</h4>
    The final scan was of something I cut a few weeks ago for our 2D cutting week. This was of a cardboard hemisphere.

 <h3> Final Project Porgress</h3>

I reached out to Ely who I converse with during our session at the SEC. He was using motion sensors to map movement in space for soft robotics, so he seemd like a great resource. We will be meeting sometime next week, hopefully after some more progress in my planning.

I am more motivated by the idea to do option number two that I listed on my final project phase–– that is an electronic measuring tool.
