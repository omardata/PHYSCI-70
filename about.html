  ### About Me
  ![image of me](./00_final/portrait.jpg)

  Hello! 

  My name is Omar Cano and I am a sophmore in Mather House, concentrating in Philosophy with an interest in Internatial Relations. A big part of my childhood was working alongside my father, who is a metal fabricator. What I most enjoyed at home and know I would also love if I found a way to include it in my course of study is “working in the shop”. My studies in philosophy, while I love them in a different way, do not stoke the same excitement nor cultivate the skills that I know this course will. I turned away from a STEM major, but my passion for fabricating and designing is still a big part of the person I would like to be and the things I want to do. The thought of having the opportunity of investing time in this  through this course has to be quite literally the most exciting possibility of the semester. 

  The last two years I was on a leave of absence from Harvard, and spent some time on a few projects–  I've included some photos below.
  
  1.) Snippet of Autocad design of two of the many components for a series of  water control lift-gates designed and fabricated to control water flow in for an irrigation system. The first a design of a power tranfer gear-box to give a mechanical advantage.

  2.) Signs designed and fabricated for local buisnesses

  3.) Sculpture/ Dry landscaping. My take on representing using sharp lines a seguaro cactus–– inside has programmable LED lights that make for a cool patterns in the dark.

  4.) Portrait of a popular local landscape–– clouds desending on the Sandia Moutains in Ablurequerque, NM. CNC cut and hand-formed, later heat treated for color.

 5.) A small building I designed and erected. Sitting on top of the center of the structure torquing bolts.

 6.) My dream car... all in shamnbles after I dissassembled most of the front-end. Over the past year I took on a partial restoration. As always, it is easier to tear apart than to put back together. Running and driving, next step: paint.
