  ### Final Project Ideas
  <em>Added JAN. 31, 2022 AT 6:30 PM </em>

  I will attempt to record the progress of my ideas regarding the final project–– big or small!

  So far there I have two competing ideas, that I will later flush out in greater detail and decide between. Both ideas arise as potential solutions to problems I have encountered during the time I've spent working in as metal fabrication shop as a fabricator and designer,

  <h4>Idea One: Semi-Automatic Arc Bender</h4>

  
  Work towards creating a machine that would allow a single person to safely and efficiently bend arcs into otherwise flat peices of round or rectangluar tubing or stock. Early in the project will include defining the scope of a successful and usesful prototpye that could become a functioning larger and more powerful machine. 

  The larger and more powerful machine (and the protoype) would include designing and fabricating the necessary mechanical and electrical components of a structure to house a three roller system, with at least one (or perhaps two) rollers connceted to computer controlled drive-system that moves material horizonatally between the rollers. Vertical movement of one of the rollers relative to the others would also need to be computer-controlled as this is what would control the rate of change in the bend of a peice of material. 

  Interfacing for the user input to the output to the two-axis drive systems would be needed and would be no small part of the project. Perhaps this domain is where the prototpye has most hope for success and easily transfering directly into a functioning final product. Ideally the machine would be capable of receiving peices of information from the user relating to the dimensions of the arc, the type of material and automatically proceed to calculate the precise steps needed and estimated time to bend the arc in piece-wise fashion. 

  Such machines already exist in either human-powered hobbiest machines or industrial automated machines. The human powered machines are great for the occasional user who does not handle heavy material, but it can be rather cumbersome and ineffiecient to use even semi-regularly. The industrial machines, usually automated, have a much greater capacity but are rather expensive. I propose protyping a machine that appeals to the semi-regular user–– one who cannot justify spending or does not need to spend on the robust capacities of industrial machines but who could benefit from a mid-range machine, one that expands their capacities beyond that of human-powered machines.

  <h4>Idea Two: Laser Sight Measuring and Projecting Device</h4>

  Work towards creating a system of communicating devices that allow for quick acurate and economical mesaurements of distances and angles between sets of points in three dimensions.

  This system might consist of a set of two or more devices that allows for a reasonable degree of accurate measument measurement of distances. There might be two or more devices, one a central unit that communicates with a smaller easily carried dongle. The central unit would register the P1 of the dongle in a coordinate system at the prompting of a user by some input on the dongle itself. Moving to a new position, the user would again prompt the central unit to register P2 and would then allow the return of a measurement on the dongle itself. As it were this could be the equivalent of a digital tape measure.

  More ambitious goals: might be to also  allow the central unit to not only aid in the registering pairs of points (measuring how long a peice of material is but to be of use to a user who needs to "project" a set of measurements. That is a user could give input to the system that it needs to measure out exactly 239.125 inches of material and the the machine would be able to register an initial point from the input of the user and aid them in measuring out 239.125 inches from that intial point.

  Yet another possibility would be to allow a mapping of a space into points which could then be uploaded into a design program in which a user would have access to the registry of stored points from which to later make use of the dimensions and relative position of these points for the specific purpose of their designs.
