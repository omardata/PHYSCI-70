  ### Week Eight: CNC Milling, Molding & Casting

  <h3> The Idea</h3>
I wanted to integrate both peices of my assignment this week.

I've also wanted to make something for my girlfriend. She is a fan of Cookiemonster from Sesame Street. She also likes keychains. 

The idea = Cookiemonster + Keychain


  <h3> First Steps, Digital Prep</h3>
First, find a photo that will lend itself to easily being traced.
Import to Abode Illustrator, trace, edit dimensions. Approximately 1.7 inches seems okay for a keychain. Export traced image to SVG for use in Fusion 360.

<p>Here is a picture of the original picture, note the color scheme because I reference it later</p> 
  ![picture of cookiemonster](./cookie.png) 

<p>Open the image in Fusion using import SVG function. </p>

<p>Now we can extrude the peices that we want to extrude. Now that I was looking at the image in the 3D programming it was time to make some more decisions as to what I wasnted the final product to look like, and how I would manufacture it. </p>

<br>

<p> I decided that I would: </p>

First cut something into a Wax block using CNC Mill SRM-20
<br>
Use that wax block as a die into which I would cast silicone. This won't be used directly in the final product
<br>
Use that silicone mold to cast another part. This will be part of the final product.
<br>
Use the original wax block to cast anther piece. This will be used in directly in the final product
<br>
3D print a second mold 
<br>
Use that 3D printed mold to cast the final keychain outer housing, after placing the cookiemonster peices inside. The cookie monster peices will be embedded in this final housing. 

<h3> CNC Wax Block</h3>
Open the SVG cookiemonter image using import SVG function. 
Select the area that was the black outline around cookiemonsters blue face, and the area that forms the black eyes and mouth. Extrude that selected area to .125"
Create a wall around theb extruded cookiemonster face, also close the bottom of the box, the walls are .125" heigh, and the bottom "floor" of the mold is also .125" thick 

<p>Here is a picture of the profile in fusion</p> 
  ![picture of profile in fusion](./profile.png) 

<br>
Export the file to an SVG, save to USB, open on SMR-20 in shop. Given the geometry of the profile, I figured I could just cut this in one pass using the 1/16" end-mill. 
(Note: Here I spent a lot of times not knowing why the window used to run the SRM-20 kept crashing. Finally figured out simple mistake: dimension scale factor was wayyyy off.)
<br>
I used compressed air to clean off some of the remaining burrs on the edges after CNC milling.

<h3> Making the 3D-Printed Mold</h3>
Using the same traced image of cookie monster, delete all other lines but the outtermost outline/ shillouette of coookiemonster. 
Scale this outline to a larger size, I'm allowing for this outline to be about .25" larger than cookiemonster's face.
Place a circle around this cookiemonster outline, select the area that lies between the two lines, and extrude it to 0.5"
Enclose the bottom of the object to form a usable mold. 



Export the file to SVG, and open in prussa slicer and print
<br>
print time: 38 minutes

<p>Here is a screenshot of the mold sliced in Prussa Slicer</p>

<p>Here is a photo of the printed mold </p>

<h3> Casting and Molding </h3>
The first step was the prepare the mold that I wanted to use to cast the black cookiemonster outline. This meant pouring silicon mold in the CNC Milled Wax block.
I used Smooth-On Silicon mold first. It entialed mixing a two part product at a 1:1 ratio, and mixing thoroughly before pouring. The mixture I used seemed to be a bit old, or perhaps someone forgot to close the lid properly.. either way the final mixture was much more viscous than I expected. Depsite much mixing, and tapping and hoping to get the silicone into each nook of the wax mold, the final silicon prodcut was far from what I wanted. 


<p>Here is a photo of the mold that I cast </p> 
  ![picture of mold that I cast](./mold.png) 


<h3>To Be Completed...</h3>
Because there was no more Smooth-On Silicone product, I will have to return to this and complete more casts of the two internal components and the external face of the key-chain that holds these internal components. But as far as the week assignment I have complted the necessary tasks and have a better idea of what to expect for future casting.. 


I have the idea of making a vibrating platform for easier casting.
